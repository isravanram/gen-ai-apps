ðŸ§  GenAI Hands-on Projects & LangChain Applications
Welcome to a collection of practical Generative AI applications and notebooks demonstrating modern techniques and tools in AI/ML, with a strong focus on LLMs, LangChain, RAG, multi-agent systems, vector databases, and production-level architectures.

This repository showcases my hands-on experience in building end-to-end systems for:

AI chatbots with memory

Document summarizers

Knowledge-based search with RAG

Multi-agent coordination with CrewAI

LLM inference using NVIDIA NIM and Hugging Face endpoints

Graph-based semantic search using Graph Query Language (GQL)

Integration with both open-source and commercial models (OpenAI, Cohere, Anthropic, etc.)
