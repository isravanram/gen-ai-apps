The video is presented by Krishna Ik, who explains the difference and connection between AI, ML, DL, and Data Science. The main points are as follows:

1. AI, or Artificial Intelligence, is the broader concept of machines being able to carry out tasks that would require human intelligence. These tasks include understanding natural language, recognizing patterns, problem-solving, and decision-making.

2. Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that provides systems the ability to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

3. Deep Learning (DL), a subset of Machine Learning, utilizes neural networks with several layers (deep neural networks) for the learning
